we can rename files and directories using the Bash scripting language. In order to rename multiple directories by using a Bash script, create a new script, and use an 'mv' command with for loop. let's understand the following example:

First, create some text files which can be renamed later. To create 10 files at once, execute the below script:

for i in {1..10}  
>do  
>touch $i.txt;  
>done;  

To verify whether the files are created or not, execute the below script:

for i in *.txt  
>do  
>echo $i;  
>done;  

Now create a variable 'newfile,' execute the below script:

for i in *.txt  
>do  
>newfile=${i/.txt/.zip};  
>echo $newfile;  
>done;  

Now, we can rename all the files using the mv command. To rename files with mv command using a bash script, execute the below script:
for i in *.txt  
>do  
>newfile=${i/.txt/.zip};  
>mv $i $newfile;  
>done:  

The above script will convert all the text files into zip files. To list the files, execute the ls command as follows:

ls -lta
